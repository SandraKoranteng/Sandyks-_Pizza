# Sandyks-_Pizza
Power BI dashboard and analysis for Sandyks'_Pizza (Mavern Pizza Challenge)

**Project Objectives**
Sandyks'_Pizza, a Greek-inspired restaurant in New Jersey, collected transactional data for the past year and needed help using it to improve operations. As a Data Analyst, my role is to analyze the data and answer the following key questions:
How many customers do we have each day? Are there any peak hours?
How many pizzas are typically in an order? Do we have any bestsellers?
How much money did we make this year? Can we identify any seasonality in the sales?
Are there any pizzas we should take off the menu, or any promotions we could leverage?

**Dashboard Features**
Total Revenue and Orders KPIs
Peak Hour Analysis
Orders Per Day and Weekly Trends
Best and Worst Selling Pizzas
Monthly Revenue Trends & Seasonality
Interactive slicers for date and pizza type

**Insights & Recommendations**
Orders peak around 12 PM, suggesting targeted lunch promotions.
Top-selling pizzas such as the Thai Chicken Pizza could be bundled for combo deals.
Low-performing pizzas such as The Brie Carre Pizza could be reviewed for removal or marketing.
Revenue spikes in May and July, indicating seasonal patterns.
